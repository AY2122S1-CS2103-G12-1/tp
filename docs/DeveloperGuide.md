### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is
responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in
[`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -c 1` Command](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the
`AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag,
instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.
<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Client/Product Feature

The add feature allows the users to add a new `Client` or `Product` with details into the application. The commands are
composed of a keyword `add` followed by `-c` for adding clients and `-p` for adding products.

The user inputs the command through `MainWindow` of the UI component, which will pass the input string to
`LogicManager`. In `LogicManager`, the `parseCommand` method in `AddressBookParser` will be called, depending on the
command word, the arguments will be used in `AddClientCommandParser` or `AddProductCommandParser` class for parsing.
The `parse` method will return the result as a `Command`, which will be executed in `LogicManager`. After the
execution, data added will be saved to storage.

For `AddClientCommandParser`, a `Model` is needed as it helps to check whether a string representing an `Order` is
valid.

The flow of the sequence diagram would be the same for adding `Products`, but the UI displayed will be different.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add -c Ben -pn 98765432` Command](images/AddClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect : How `add` may be executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : User can add either a client or a product at a time
    * Pros : Allows the user to focus on adding a client or product
    * Cons : Might be slow if there are a lot of clients/products to add
* **Alternative 2** : User can add multiple clients or products
    * Pros : Allows the user to add multiple clients or products in one command
    * Cons : Difficult to find a client/product since the command can be very long, in this case, updates will have to
      be done through the`edit` command (requires the user to memorise the IDs)

### Edit Client/Product Feature

This feature allows the users to edit the details of a `Client` or `Product` of their choice. When editing a `Client` or
`Product`, the user is required to enter at least 1 field to edit in the input command.

The user input is first handled and retrieved by `MainWindow` in the UI component before being passed to the
`LogicManager` to execute. First, `LogicManager` will call `AddressBookParser`, which will pass the inputs to
`EditClientCommandParser`, parsing the inputs and returning a `EditClientCommand`. The command will then be executed in
`LogicManager`, returning a `CommandResult`. `StorageManager` will then attempt to save the current state of address
book into local storage. The `CommandResult` will finally be returned to `MainWindow`, which will display feedback of
the `CommandResult` to the user.

The flow of the sequence diagram would be the same for editing `Products`, but the UI displayed will be different.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit -c 1 -n Sora` Command](images/EditClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect : How `edit` may be executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : User can edit either a client or a product at a time
    * Pros : Allows the user to focus on editing a particular client or product
    * Cons : Unable to edit multiple clients or products at the same time
* **Alternative 2** : User can edit multiple clients or products
    * Pros : Saves time if the user wish to edit a field in all clients or products to the same value
    * Cons : More complex code which would lead to higher amount of error

### View Client/Product Feature

This feature allows the users to view the details of the `Client` or `Product` of their choice. When viewing a `Client`,
more details such as `Products` bought before, will be visible to the user. The user input is first handled and
retrieved by `MainWindow` in the UI component before being passed to the `LogicManager` to execute.

First, `LogicManager` will call `AddressBookParser`, which will pass the inputs to `ViewClientCommandParser`, parsing
the inputs and returning a `ViewClientCommand`. The command will then be executed in `LogicManager`, returning a
`CommandResult` which will be returned to the user. The flow of the sequence diagram would be the same for viewing
`Products`, but the UI displayed will be different.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view -c 5` Command](images/ViewClientCommandDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect : How `view` may be executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : User can view either a client or product
    * Pros : Allows the user to focus on a particular client or product
    * Cons : Unable to view multiple clients or products
* **Alternative 2** : User can view multiple clients or products
    * Pros : Easier comparisons between clients or products
    * Cons : More complex code which would lead to higher amount of error

### Delete Client/Product Feature

This feature allows the users to delete a `Client` or `Product` of their choice. When deleting a `Client` or
`Product`, the user is required to list all clients/products using the `list -p` or `list -c` command

The user input is first handled and retrieved by `MainWindow` in the UI component before being passed to the
`LogicManager` to execute. First, `LogicManager` will call `AddressBookParser`, which will pass the inputs to
`DeleteClientCommandParser`, parsing the inputs and returning a `DeleteClientCommand` or . The command will then be
executed in `LogicManager`, returning a `CommandResult`. `StorageManager` will then attempt to save the current state of
address book into local storage. The `CommandResult` will finally be returned to `MainWindow`, which will display
feedback of the `CommandResult` to the user.

The flow of the sequence diagram would be the same for editing `Products`, but the UI displayed will be different.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -c 1` Command](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect : How `delete` may be executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : User can delete either a client or a product at a time
    * Pros : Allows the user to focus on deleting a particular client or product
    * Cons : Unable to delete multiple clients or products at the same time
* **Alternative 2** : User can delete multiple clients or products
    * Pros : Saves time if the user wish to delete multiple clients or products at the same time
    * Cons : More complex code which would lead to higher amount of error

### Find Client/Product Feature

This feature allows the users to find a `Client` or `Product` based on their `name`.

The user input is first handled and retrieved by `MainWindow` in the UI component before being passed to the
`LogicManager` to execute. First, `LogicManager` will call `AddressBookParser`, which will pass the inputs to
`FindClientCommandParser`, parsing the inputs and returning a `FindClientCommand`. The command will then be executed in
`LogicManager`, returning a `CommandResult`.The `CommandResult` will finally be returned to `MainWindow`, which will
display feedback of the `CommandResult` to the user.

The flow of the sequence diagram would be the same for finding `Products`, but the UI displayed will be different.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find -c john` Command](images/FindClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect : How `find` may be executed**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)** : User can find a client/product by their name
    * Pros : Allows the user to focus on finding a particular client or product
    * Cons : Unable to find clients or products without name
* **Alternative 2** : User can find clients by their details such as name, address, email, etc.. and products by their
  name, price, etc..
    * Pros : Saves time if the user is unable to remember the exact name of a client/product.
    * Cons : More complex code which would lead to higher amount of error

### Command History Feature

This feature allows the user to navigate to previous commands using `â†‘` and `â†“` keys.

The command histories are stored in an `ArrayList<String>`, as well as with the help of a `Index`. Each time the user
inputs a command, it is stored into the `ArrayList`. `Index` begins at the end of the `ArrayList`. As user inputs `â†‘`,
previous command will be shown till no more available. `â†“` is used to go back to the next command. As user reaches the
last and latest command stored in `ArrayList`, the next `â†“` will clear the command input field. At any time, user can
choose to just stop and proceed on to edit or input the current history command.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/Redo Feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the
address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state,
then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check
if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to
the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses
`Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than
attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus,
the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
