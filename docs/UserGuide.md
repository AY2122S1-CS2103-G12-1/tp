## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Ben`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `NAME [-e EMAIL]` can be used as `Ben -e ben@gmail.com` or as `Ben`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-pn PHONE_NUMBER -e EMAIL`, `-e EMAIL -pn PHONE_NUMBER` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `-pn 12341234 -pn 56785678`, only `-pn 56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.
